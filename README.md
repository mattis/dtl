# a Dependently Typed Language

In this FoPL'11 project  we are going to implement a dependently typed
programming language based on [Agda][1]. We want to learn how a
dependent type checker works. The plan is to begin with implementing
the a language with lambda abstractions, dependent pairs and unit as
the only built in data types. Then, depending on how much time is
left, we will proceed with adding algebraic data types and pattern
matching.
